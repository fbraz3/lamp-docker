# Braz LAMP Docker Image

This repository provides Docker images for LAMP stack (`L`inux, `A`pache, `M`ariaDB, and `P`HP-FPM).

It is designed to simplify the deployment of PHP applications with a robust and modern environment, offering both **Development** and **Production** versions to meet different deployment needs.

The images are built on top of other modular images from the `fbraz3` ecosystem, ensuring flexibility, maintainability, and ease of use.

We also provide an AI generated [DeepWiki Page](https://deepwiki.com/fbraz3/lamp-docker) with more technical information.

ðŸ’¡ For a complete list of available images, please visit the [PHP System Docs](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-system-docs) page.

## Image Versions

This project provides two distinct versions for different use cases:

### Development Version (`-dev` suffix)
- **Purpose**: Designed for local development and testing
- **Features**:
  - MariaDB with **no root password** (empty password)
  - phpMyAdmin accessible at `/pma/` endpoint
  - Relaxed security settings for ease of development
  - Direct database access without authentication

### Production Version (no suffix)
- **Purpose**: Optimized for production environments
- **Features**:
  - MariaDB with **mandatory root password** configuration
  - **Enforced password security**: Container will fail to start if using default password
  - **Custom SQL scripts support**: Execute custom SQL files at startup
  - **No phpMyAdmin** included for security
  - Secure database configuration
  - Root password configurable via environment variables
  - Anonymous users and test databases removed
  - Enhanced security settings

## Tags

The image follows a consistent tagging scheme:

### Base Images (Vanilla LAMP Stack)
- **Production**: `fbraz3/lamp:{php_version}` (e.g., `8.2`, `8.3`, `8.4`)
- **Development**: `fbraz3/lamp:{php_version}-dev` (e.g., `8.2-dev`, `8.3-dev`)

### Phalcon Images (With Phalcon Framework)
- **Production**: `fbraz3/lamp:{php_version}-phalcon` (e.g., `8.2-phalcon`, `8.3-phalcon`)
- **Development**: `fbraz3/lamp:{php_version}-phalcon-dev` (e.g., `8.2-phalcon-dev`)

### Latest Tags
- `fbraz3/lamp:latest` - Latest production version
- `fbraz3/lamp:latest-dev` - Latest development version  
- `fbraz3/lamp:latest-phalcon` - Latest Phalcon production version
- `fbraz3/lamp:latest-phalcon-dev` - Latest Phalcon development version

### Architecture Support
- All images support both `amd64` and `arm64` architectures
- LAMP variants are also available as `fbraz3/lamp:{tag}`

## Flavors

This image supports multiple flavors to cater to different use cases:

- `Vanilla`: A standard LAMP stack with no additional frameworks.
- `Phalcon`: Includes the Phalcon PHP framework pre-installed.

## How to Use

### Development Version

Perfect for local development with easy database access and debugging tools.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  web:
    image: fbraz3/lamp:8.4-dev  # or fbraz3/lamp:8.4-phalcon-dev
    volumes:
      - ./:/app/public/
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:80:80"
```

The development version includes:
- **phpMyAdmin** accessible at `http://localhost/pma/`
- **MariaDB** with no root password (empty password)
- Direct database access for development

### Production Version

Optimized for production environments with enhanced security.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  web:
    image: fbraz3/lamp:8.4  # or fbraz3/lamp:8.4-phalcon
    volumes:
      - ./:/app/public/
      - ./sql-scripts:/sql-scripts  # Optional: Custom SQL scripts
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:80:80"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=your_app_db
      - MYSQL_USER=app_user
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=app_user_password
```

Run the following command to start the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Your application will be accessible at `http://localhost/`.

## Custom SQL Scripts

The production version of this image supports the execution of custom SQL scripts at startup. 

To use this feature, place your SQL files in a directory (e.g., `./sql-scripts`) and mount it as a volume to the container:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: fbraz3/lamp:8.4  # Production version
    volumes:
      - ./:/app/public/
      - ./sql-scripts:/sql-scripts  # Custom SQL scripts directory
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:80:80"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
```

SQL scripts in the mounted directory will be executed in alphabetical order during container startup.

## Security Considerations

- **Development Version**: This version has relaxed security settings for ease of development. It is not recommended for production use.
- **Production Version**: This version enforces strict security measures. Ensure that you configure the root password and remove any default or test databases.

## Environment Variables

You can configure various aspects of the container using environment variables. 

Commonly used variables include:

- `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Set the root password for MariaDB.
- `MYSQL_DATABASE`: Create a default database.
- `MYSQL_USER` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: Create a new user with access to the default database.

Refer to the [official MariaDB Docker image documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) for a complete list of environment variables.

## Manage PHP Directives via Environment Variables
This image allows you to customize PHP directives using environment variables. 

For detailed instructions, refer to the [php-fpm-docker documentation](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-fpm-docker#manage-php-directives-via-environment-variables).

## Cronjobs
Cronjobs can be configured by binding a file to `/cronfile` in the container. The system will automatically install and execute the jobs.

For more details, see the [php-fpm-docker documentation](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-fpm-docker#cronjobs).

## Sending Mails
To enable email sending, this image relies on the configuration provided in the `php-base-docker` project.

Follow the instructions in the [php-base-docker documentation](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-base-docker#sending-mails) to set up email functionality.
